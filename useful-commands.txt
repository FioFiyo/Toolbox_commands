Dropping tables:

Deleting branches: 
	If you want more detailed explanations of the following commands, then see the long answers in the next section.

Deleting a remote branch:
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-to-delete-a-git-branch-both-locally-and-remotely

	git push origin --delete <branch>  # Git version 1.7.0 or newer
	git push origin :<branch>          # Git versions older than 1.7.0
Deleting a local branch:

	git branch --delete <branch>
	git branch -d <branch> # Shorter version
	git branch -D <branch> # Force delete un-merged branches
Deleting a local remote-tracking branch:

	git branch --delete --remotes <remote>/<branch>
	git branch -dr <remote>/<branch> # Shorter

	git fetch <remote> --prune # Delete multiple obsolete tracking bringanches
	git fetch <remote> -p      # Shorter
Amend comments on commit
	Commit has not been pushed online
	On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend.
	Type git commit --amend and press Enter
Revert commits as group
	get git log and the commit ##
	git revert commit##..HEAD

Revert single commit but keep in log the revert(clean way):
	git revert --strategy resolve <commit>

Revert merge when NOT PUSHED YET
	git log and check last commit
	git reset --hard lascommit_sha

Rename git branches:
	 current branch just do. git branch -m new_name.
	 another branch git branch -m old_name new_name.
	 If pushed

Revert to previous Gemlock if bundle update broke things: 
	git checkout -- Gemfile.lock

RAILS
	bin/spring stop >- When rails c is fucked up
	bin/rails server -b0.0.0.0 (can only work through this binding address).
	-T (to install without testing)
	—database = postgress (to override the sqlite3  default )
	bin/rails console (REPL)-> interacts with development stage
	kill -9 $(lsof -i tcp:3000 -t) -> To KILL a server if already running
	lsof -i tcp port

	bin/rails generate migration name_of_it description:text (use bin/rails g for short)
	Easier:
	bin/rails g model Product description:text (this will create the model and migration file)

RAILS SIMULATE APP ON MOBILE:
	1. Get current IP address
	2. If on Vagrant run rails s -b 0.0.0.0 (set bind to 0.0.0.0 in case it doesn’t work without vagrant)
	3. current_IP_address:3000 on your browser
